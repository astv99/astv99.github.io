# Title: Coding Unboxed #
## Goal: "Beat the learning curve with Steve" ##

### Blog "Problem Statement" ###

- **Problem**: There are a lot of online courses and other learning resources on the Internet for new/aspiring devs. Too many, in fact. What are the best ones? And how could anyone possibly sort through all of them to learn what they need?
- **Solution**: This blog. ;)

### Blog Content/Description ###
- Filtering the good online courses from the not so good ones, to provide a recommended "study guide" for new/aspiring devs
 - a continually-updated "study guide" of recommended online courses, ebooks, print books, & other learning resources (online & offline)
 - additional topical recommendations based on Kamran Ahmed's annual Developer Roadmap ([https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/))
 - positive & negative reviews of online courses, ebooks, print books, & other learning resources (online & offline)
- opinionated blog entries on career and technical advice for new & aspiring developers
- hands-on coding tutorials (examples: "Building your first non-trivial front-end app in Angular/React/Vue", "Building your first API", "Putting the parts together for your first full-stack JS project")
- alerts on upcoming conferences, meetups, and other events in tech

### [Post] Colorado tech events in 2020 ###

It's the start of a new year! For developers that can mean a lot of things, but it also means the start of a new year for tech conferences & related events. Why should you attend a tech conference? I think the better question is: why not? Granted, while some people could certainly make the argument that conferences are limited opportunities for learning, they're invaluable for a lot of other reasons, not the least of which is being able to connect to your local peer community of software developers and other technical and creative types. Conferences can also certainly be expensive to attend (and I've seen some with ticket prices over $2000!), but it's always possible to find good inexpensive or even free events. With that said, below is a list of all of the tech events in Colorado in 2020 that I currently know of (this list will certainly be updated later as I discover more):

#### Recommendations ####

If you're primarily a front-end developer or a designer, I'd recommend attending **ETHDenver** in February even if you don't know anything about the Ethereum blockchain. It's one of the few events on the list that's totally free to attend and is a great opportunity to network and help build something really cool.

I also recommend attending either **Boulder Startup Week** or **Denver Startup Week** (or even both), depending on which city you're closer to. Both are a week-long series of sessions and are also totally free to attend!

For paid conferences, **Develop Denver** is my top recommendation. It's a general conference for all types of software developers, including for designers and other creative & technical types. And even if you can't swing the ticket price, the organizers have been known to offer a volunteer incentive in exchange for a ticket in past years which is well worth taking advantage of. The date hasn't been announced yet, but I'll update again here when it has been!
