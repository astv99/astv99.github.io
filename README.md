### Develop Denver 2019 ###

A bit delayed on this I know, since the conference was back in August! But I haven't forgotten about my experience there, as it was memorable in so many ways and I'm really looking forward to next year's.

Some proper introduction needs to be done first: Develop Denver is a local software developer- (and designer-) oriented conference for local folks throughout the Denver metro area in Colorado, inclusive of everywhere between Fort Collins and Colorado Springs (and beyond!). The two key things that set Develop Denver apart from other technical conferences is: 

1. It's organized for the local developer community by local volunteer developers, as opposed to a company or official organization

2. It's not just focused on one area of software development. A quick look at the talks from this year's conference provide a good idea of the variety of topics that were covered, from career management to accessibility to databases to agile, and CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails: https://developdenver.org/events

The fact that the conference is organized by actual local devs helps make it feel like a large community event, rather than your usual soulless technical conference, and this year's was no different. So many people helped bring a unique infectious energy to the event, from the organizers who were constantly running around and making sure everything was in place, to the speakers who were clearly passionate about their talks, and everyone else who came just to hang out for the 2 days. Food & drink allowances were provided for everyone who purchased a ticket, along with special opening and closing ceremonies, which helped to make the event feel more official, even if everything had a distinctly unofficial vibe. All told, it was a fantastic opportunity to meet new people (i.e., developers) from around the Denver area with so many different backgrounds.

A few of the speakers that I either met for the first time or re-connected with include:

- Dan Moore, who runs the Letters To A New Developer blog that I regularly follow: [https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/)
- Kyle Coberly, one of the lead organizers: [https://kylecoberly.com/](https://kylecoberly.com/)
- Kim Schlesinger, another lead organizer: [https://kimschlesinger.com/](https://kimschlesinger.com/)
- Brian Schiller, developer @ Devetry: [https://brianschiller.com/](https://brianschiller.com/)

Oh and I gave a talk at Develop Denver too! It was about Developing on Windows: https://developdenver.org/talks/236. Will definitely be writing more on that experience later.

Anyone who missed the conference, or would just like to get a glimpse of what happened, can take a look at the available talk slides and on YouTube where videos will be posted!
